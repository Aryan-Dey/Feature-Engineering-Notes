# üõ†Ô∏è Feature Engineering Practice Projects

This repository contains my **practice notebooks, scripts, and hands-on experiments** focused on mastering the essential techniques of **Feature Engineering** in Machine Learning. All code here is part of my **self-learning journey** through YouTube courses and real-world projects.

These notebooks demonstrate my understanding and application of various preprocessing techniques crucial for improving model accuracy and performance.

## üîç What's Inside?

### 1. **Handling Missing Values**
- Techniques: Mean/Median/Mode Imputation, KNN Imputer, MICE, Dropping Strategies.
- Types of missing data: MCAR, MAR, MNAR.
- Visualizations for missing data patterns.

### 2. **Encoding Categorical Variables**
- Label Encoding
- One-Hot Encoding
- Ordinal Encoding
- Frequency Encoding
- Target Mean Encoding

### 3. **Feature Scaling Techniques**
- Min-Max Scaling
- Standardization (Z-score Scaling)
- Robust Scaling
- Power Transforms (Box-Cox, Yeo-Johnson)

### 4. **Feature Transformation**
- Log, Square Root, and Box-Cox Transformations
- Handling Skewness
- Distribution visualizations (Before/After)

### 5. **Outlier Handling**
- IQR Method
- Z-score Method
- Winsorization

### 6. **Binning**
- Fixed-width binning
- Quantile binning
- KBinsDiscretizer

### 7. **Feature Extraction & Creation**
- Date-Time features
- Text-based features (Length, Word Count, etc.)
- Polynomial Features

### 8. **Feature Selection**
- Pearson Correlation
- Chi-Square Test
- Mutual Information
- Variance Threshold
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
- SelectKBest
- Custom correlation-based filter function
